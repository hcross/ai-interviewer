# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Hoani
**Date:** 2026-01-18

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Interviewer agent strategy for the success of created agents
**Goals:** Maximize agents' goal achievement through an optimal interviewer approach

### Session Setup

We are focusing on defining the interviewer agent's approach strategy. The objective is to ensure that the agents created by the project achieve their goals effectively. The session aims to produce a clear description of this maximizing strategy.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** User-Selected Techniques
**Selected Techniques:**

- **Reversal Inversion**: Deliberately flip problems upside down to reveal hidden assumptions and fresh angles.
- **First Principles Thinking**: Strip away assumptions to rebuild from fundamental truths.

**Selection Rationale:** This combination first allows for the identification of potential failures and anti-patterns (Reversal) to purify the vision, then to rebuild a robust strategy on indisputable foundations (First Principles).

## Technique Execution Results

**Reversal Inversion:**

- **Interactive Focus:** Identify worst practices (anti-patterns) to understand the root causes of an agent's failure.
- **Key Breakthroughs:** Identification of "Verbal Obesity" and "Question Barrage" as silent killers, as well as toxic behaviors (hounding, social breakdown).
- **User Creative Strengths:** Ability to identify fine psychological nuances (annoyance, mental load) beyond simple technical errors.
- **Energy Level:** Engaged and analytical.

**First Principles Thinking:**

- **Building on Previous:** Rebuilding a "bulletproof" strategy from the ruins identified during the inversion.
- **New Insights:** Definition of 3 Fundamental Pillars (Mandate/Consent, Empathetic Mirror, Deterministic Closure) and 3 Defense Protocols for extreme cases (Temporal Breathing, Transactional De-escalation, Trust Marking).
- **Developed Ideas:** The concept of a dynamic "Mental Load Score" and the notion of an "emissary" (mandated) agent for credibility.

**Overall Creative Journey:** A very productive session that began by destroying preconceived notions about "what to do" by looking at "what kills the interaction," then building a robust strategy capable of handling not only the nominal case but also the worst user scenarios (ghosts, refractories, saboteurs).

### Creative Facilitation Narrative

The session followed a perfect curve of divergence (creative sabotage) then convergence (structuring by principles). The user showed great lucidity about human limits when facing AI, insisting on respect for mental load and consent. The collaboration helped transform intuitions ("don't be overbearing") into concrete technical protocols ("Temporal Breathing," "Trust Marking").

### Session Highlights

**User Creative Strengths:** Extreme user focus, pragmatism, anticipation of "real" (non-ideal) human behaviors.
**AI Facilitation Approach:** Provocation through the absurd (Reversal) then rigorous structuring (First Principles).
**Breakthrough Moments:** The definition of the "Minimalist Transactional Mode" for refractory users.
**Energy Flow:** Constant and constructive, flowing smoothly from critique to solution.

## Idea Organization and Prioritization

**Thematic Organization:**

- **Theme 1: The Foundations of Trust (The Mandate)**: Focus on legitimacy (Who, For whom, Why, Consent).
- **Theme 2: Cognitive Ecology (The Mirror)**: Focus on mental load (Conciseness, One idea/message, Empathy score).
- **Theme 3: Operational Rigor (The Closure)**: Focus on finality (Variable resolution, Determining "Done").
- **Theme 4: Survival Protocols (Anti-Fragility)**: Focus on extreme cases (Temporal breathing, De-escalation, Trust marking).

**Prioritization Results:**

- **Top Priority Ideas:** The Mandate Protocol and the Empathetic Mirror. Essential for the survival of the relationship.
- **Quick Win Opportunities:** Temporal Breathing (Timeout) to avoid infinite loops.
- **Breakthrough Concepts:** Transactional De-escalation and Trust Marking to manage hostile or dishonest users.

**Action Planning:**

### Plan 1: Mandate & Consent Protocol
- **Action:** Create the standardized welcome message template.
- **Timeline:** Immediate.

### Plan 2: Empathetic Mirror
- **Action:** Implement a mental load scoring algorithm for each message generated by the agent.
- **Timeline:** Short term.

### Plan 3: Temporal Breathing
- **Action:** Configure the 24h follow-up triggers and session timeouts.
- **Timeline:** Medium term.

## Session Summary and Insights

**Key Achievements:**
- Creation of a self-adaptive interviewer strategy.
- Proactive protection of user experience and data quality.
- Robustness against adversarial behaviors.

**Session Reflections:**
The use of inversion was the most fertile moment, leading to the realization that technology matters less than the psychology of interaction for the success of interviewer agents.
